# Denoising and Deblurring a Signal

    The given code in code.py file gives you two graphs of x1[n] and x2[n] to analyse the
    deblurred and denoised signals of the distorted signal given in the problem statement.
    Also the MSE values are provided to check the accuracy of the method we used.
    Lesser the MSE value, accurate the method.


## Installation :

    Python 3.7 
    or later versions should be pre-installed.

    Make sure you have unziped the zip file, else the code may not work.


## Dependencies :

    Given 3 libraries of python should be pre-installed :
        1. pandas
        2. numpy
        3. matplotlib

    To install them, write following code line in command prompt :
        pip install pandas          
        pip install numpy
        pip install matplotlib


## Final Steps :

* Run the script.py file in programming IDE of your choice. 

* The code would demand for the file path of data.csv as input, so enter it in console and make sure that path ends with "data.csv".

* And Boom, your results are ready. [two graphs and MSE values]
